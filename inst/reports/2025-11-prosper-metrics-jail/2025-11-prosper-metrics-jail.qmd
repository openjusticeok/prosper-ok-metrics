# Executive Summary
Tulsa County Jail's average daily population and bookings trended downward
in 2025 compared to 2024[, continuing a multi-year pattern of declines.]

- **The jail's average daily population (ADP) in 2025 is estimated to be
`r fmt_num(jail_analysis$key_metrics$value[jail_analysis$key_metrics$metric == "Average Daily Population (Tulsa County)"])`,
a
`r fmt_pct(jail_analysis$key_metrics$yoy_change[jail_analysis$key_metrics$metric == "Average Daily Population (Tulsa County)"])`
decrease from 2024.**
- **Total bookings to the jail in 2025 are estimated to be
`r fmt_num(jail_analysis$key_metrics$value[jail_analysis$key_metrics$metric == "Annual Bookings (Tulsa County)"])`,
a
`r fmt_pct(jail_analysis$key_metrics$yoy_change[jail_analysis$key_metrics$metric == "Annual Bookings (Tulsa County)"])`
decrease from 2024.**

## Data limitations in 2025 mean estimates required cross-validation from multiple sources
In 2025, Tulsa County Jail (the David L. Moss Criminal Justice Center),
migrated its Jail Management System to a new vendor, 365Labs Public Safety Platform,
which impacted data availability and reporting capabilities for much of the year.
The jail's internal reporting tools were not fully functional for some time after
the migration, and prior web scrapers became non-fuctional after the new
community data portal was launched.

Given these unique challenges, this report attempts to provide an update on key
metrics for the jail population and bookings by using a variety of acquired data sources to
cross-validate estimates.

**The data sources used are:**

- **OK Policy's Scraper:** Data in OK Policy's database from a scraper developed by OK Policy.
  This scraper collected daily population data from the Tulsa County Jail's newest public data portal
  after the new portal was launched.
- **Jail Data Initiative's Scraper:** Data was acquired through a data sharing agreement
  with the Jail Data Intiative (JDI). JDI's data was collected via a web scraper
  that pulled daily population data from the Tulsa County Jail's public data portal
  before the new portal and after a several month gap, after the new portal launched.
- **Asemio's Scraper:** Data in OK Policy's database from a web scraper developed by Asemio. This scraper
  collected daily population data from the Tulsa County Jail's public data portal
  prior to the migration, but was not functional after the new portal was launched.
- **Past Starling Analytics Report:** Data from prior reports to GKFF by Starling Analytics
  which cite the source as Tulsa County's JailNet system.

Over the coming months, we will continue work with the Tulsa County jail
administrator and their IT staff to improve data access and reporting capabilities
to ensure accurate and timely information is available moving forward. We will also be
able to use that data to validate and refine the estimates presented in this report.
