Open Justice Oklahoma estimates that between \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and

associated with HB 3205 between Q2 of FY 2023 and Q2 of FY 2024.
\end{abstract}


\section{Background}\label{background}

A bill reducing fines and fees for families of children involved in the
criminal legal system (HB 3205) went into effect July 1, 2022 (Q1 FY
2023). HB 3205 struck a clause of 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-2-301 which
stated that the parent or other legal custodian were responsible for
costs associated with legal representation. It limited the twenty-five
dollar probation fee to only those counties that have a juvenile bureau;
a provision that the fee only be applied to those with ability to pay
was already in place. Prior to HB 3205 counties without a juvenile
bureau were directing the revenue from this probation fee to the Office
of Juvenile Affairs (OJA).

HB 3205 also struck 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-2-509 which required a
juvenile drug court user fee of up to twenty dollars per month, in
addition to ``court costs, treatment costs, drug-testing costs, and
supervision fees''. While the cost of treatment was paid to the
treatment provider, drug-testing and supervision fees were directed to
the Juvenile Drug Court Revolving Fund, and all other costs and fees
were directed to the court clerk.

This analysis uses OJA referral data beginning October 1, 2022 (Q2 FY
2023) to estimate the impact of HB 3205 during a period of full
implementation.

\section{Data}\label{data}

The Office of Juvenile Affairs (OJA) provided data on youth offender
referrals from January 2018 through December 2023. The county and month
in which referrals were made are included.

While referral counts provide insight into the number of Oklahoma's
youth encountering the juvenile system, they are not sufficient to
estimate the number of individuals directly impacted by the reforms
outlined in the section above. We used county level estimates of
household and family sizes conducted by the Census in the 5-year
American Community Survey to estimate the total number of individuals
impacted since the burden of court fines and fees, especially in the
case of children involved in the criminal legal system, is borne by
families of the impacted individual.

County, rather than state, level demographics are used to account for
some of the variance in the number of Oklahomans most directly involved
in caring for the youth referred to OJA. Though the 5-year estimates
from the Census hold household and family size constant across years,
this measure was chosen due to data quality issues with the 1-year ACS
associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to Census definitions, household size refers to the total
number of individuals living in a housing unit, while family size
consists of only those housing unit residents that are related by birth,
marriage, or other legal status. Aggregated, household size tends to be
greater than family size; taken together, these two estimations provide
reasonable bounds for estimating the total direct impact of HB 3205.
