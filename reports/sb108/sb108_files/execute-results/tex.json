This bill, rolling back provisions of State Question 780, would make possession of a controlled substance (excluding marijuana) a felony crime after the fourth such conviction in ten years. While the punishment for a misdemeanor possession conviction is up to \\$1,000 dollars and/or up to one year confinement, a felony conviction for the same crime can result in a fine of up to \\$5,000 dollars and/or up to 5 years imprisonment.\n\nThis analysis uses historical data on convictions for possession of a controlled substance to better understand how prevalent the situation of having four or more convictions within 10 years is, and thereby, estimate the number of people who would be impacted by this legislation should it be enacted into law in a future legislative session.\n\n## Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='sb108_cache/pdf/load_data_a66b01552f210c5c9f6fe151fd77c8c0'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Source\n\nOpen Justice Oklahoma maintains a database of administrative court records which includes information on all criminal misdemeanors and felonies filed in Oklahoma beginning in 2001. Case information is systematically collected from publicly available data hosted on the [Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN)](https://www.oscn.net/v4/) website.\n\n* **Initial data pull: All CF / CM cases filed Jan 1 2001 - Dec 31, 2022, statewide**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- ojo_tbl(\"case\", .con = ojodb) |>\n  filter(\n    case_type %in% c(\"CM\", \"CF\"),\n    date_filed >= \"2001-01-01\",\n    date_filed < \"2023-01-01\"\n  ) |>\n  left_join(\n    ojo_tbl(\"count\", .con = ojodb),\n    by = c(\"id\" = \"case_id\"),\n    suffix = c(\"\", \"_count\")\n  ) |>\n  ojo_collect()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nOur initial data pull has **2,460,554 rows**. Since only the 13 official OSCN counties report the charges in each case, we are limited to just those for this analysis of drug possession charges. **1,440,253 of the rows** were from these counties, and **1,438,749 had non-missing values** for `count_as_filed`.\n\n* **Full list of OSCN counties:** Tulsa, Oklahoma, Cleveland, Rogers, Payne, Comanche, Garfield, Canadian, Logan, Adair, Pushmataha, Roger Mills, Ellis\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the data, there were 740,744 unique **cases** filed in OSCN counties, compared to 1,761,045 cases filed statewide. In other words, 42.06% of the cases were filed in the 13 OSCN counties. Accordingly, we can approximate what the statewide results might look like by assuming our end result accounts for roughly 42% of the total population affected by SB108.\n\n* **Data availability, per county:**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|District    |N Rows  |N with Nonmissing Charge |Percent Missing Charge |\n|:-----------|:-------|:------------------------|:----------------------|\n|TULSA       |503,027 |502,948                  |0.02%                  |\n|OKLAHOMA    |486,993 |486,751                  |0.05%                  |\n|CLEVELAND   |124,083 |124,074                  |0.01%                  |\n|ROGERS      |78,098  |78,072                   |0.03%                  |\n|PAYNE       |61,604  |60,560                   |1.69%                  |\n|COMANCHE    |47,052  |47,012                   |0.09%                  |\n|GARFIELD    |38,612  |38,607                   |0.01%                  |\n|CANADIAN    |37,579  |37,568                   |0.03%                  |\n|LOGAN       |25,094  |25,087                   |0.03%                  |\n|ADAIR       |18,518  |18,490                   |0.15%                  |\n|PUSHMATAHA  |14,420  |14,419                   |0.01%                  |\n|ROGER MILLS |2,942   |2,930                    |0.41%                  |\n|ELLIS       |2,231   |2,231                    |0%                     |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n* **Data availability, per filing year**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Year      |N Rows  |N with Nonmissing Charge |Percent Missing Charge |\n|:---------|:-------|:------------------------|:----------------------|\n|2001-2003 |171,592 |170,865                  |0.42%                  |\n|2004-2006 |179,679 |179,363                  |0.18%                  |\n|2007-2009 |184,855 |184,793                  |0.03%                  |\n|2010-2012 |184,765 |184,682                  |0.04%                  |\n|2013-2015 |234,559 |234,476                  |0.04%                  |\n|2016-2018 |227,896 |227,819                  |0.03%                  |\n|2019-2021 |195,667 |195,554                  |0.06%                  |\n|2022-2024 |61,240  |61,197                   |0.07%                  |\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Methodology\n\nThis analysis looks across all 13 counties which report data on charges filed, and across all complete years of misdemeanor and felony data for charges of possession of a controlled substance. We then use a text classification tool to assist with finding all the simple drug possession charges in the data, which allows us to finally report the number of convictions on such charges per defendant.\n\nOur figures are likely to underestimate the total number of convictions by a relatively small, but still methodologically significant amount due to the expungement of records over time. The magnitude of this bias will be greater for earlier years, but can be roughly quantified by exploiting the court case id schema mandated by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\n### Cleaning / classifying count data\n\nThe UCCS tool provides estimates of the probability that each classification was correct. We use regex pattern matching to further examine all classifications with a confidence of less than 80%.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](sb108_files/figure-pdf/probability-distribution-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThe 20 most common verbatim count descriptions -- looking only at charges that were **included** -- are shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{longtable}{lr}\n\\toprule\ncount\\_as\\_disposed & n \\\\ \n\\midrule\nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG & 12318 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE & 10312 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG & 10268 \\\\ \nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG METHAMPHETAMINE & 4874 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE & 4566 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CDS METHAMPHETAMINE & 4541 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE METH & 4160 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF MARIJUANA & 4006 \\\\ \nMARIJUANA MISDEMEANOR & 3853 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE MARIJUANA & 3086 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CDS MARIJUANA & 2718 \\\\ \nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA & 2567 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE MARIJUANA SCHD I & 2516 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE METH SCHD II & 2064 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CDS SCHD II & 2058 \\\\ \nPOSS OF CDS & 2029 \\\\ \nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE & 1928 \\\\ \nCONTROLLED DRUG SCHEDULE II FELONY & 1534 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE & 1292 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE SCHED II & 1230 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe 20 most common verbatim count descriptions -- looking only at charges that were **excluded** -- are shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{longtable}{lr}\n\\toprule\ncount\\_as\\_disposed & n \\\\ \n\\midrule\nDUI ALCOHOL & 29961 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA & 24833 \\\\ \nDRIVING UNDER SUSPENSION DUS & 24195 \\\\ \nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA & 21474 \\\\ \nOBSTRUCTING AN OFFICER & 19190 \\\\ \nPUBLIC INTOXICATION & 19048 \\\\ \nBURGLARY SECOND DEGREE & 17865 \\\\ \nLARCENY OF MERCHANDISE FROM RETAILER & 17307 \\\\ \nDRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE & 17203 \\\\ \nASSAULT AND BATTERY DOMESTIC & 17038 \\\\ \nVIOLATION OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION ACT & 15400 \\\\ \nBOGUS CHECK & 15020 \\\\ \nVIOLATION OF PROTECTIVE ORDER & 13403 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF PARAPHERNALIA & 12465 \\\\ \nFAILURE TO CARRY INSURANCE SECURITY VERIFICATION FORM & 11183 \\\\ \nCONCEALING STOLEN PROPERTY & 10637 \\\\ \nUNAUTHORIZED USE OF VEHICLE & 9370 \\\\ \nDRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL & 8544 \\\\ \nRESISTING AN OFFICER & 8510 \\\\ \nDRIVING WITHOUT A DRIVER S LICENSE & 8492 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFinally, we add the defendant info onto each case so we can see how many have 4+ simple possession charges.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nOf the **152,557 total rows / charges** in the data, **148,127** have an associated person record (**97.1%**).\n\n## Results\n\n### How many **simple possession** charges per defendant?\n\nTo begin, we'll remove charges that have yet to be disposed (`disposition` is `NA` or something aside from \"DISMISSED\", \"DEFERRED\", or \"CONVICTED\"), then count how many each individual defendant has in the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](sb108_files/figure-pdf/conviction-count-plot-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### How many **non-marijuana** simple possession charges per defendant?\n\nNext, we'll repeat this same analysis with marijuana-specific charges removed, as they would be excluded from SB108:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](sb108_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### How many defendants have 4+ **non-marijuana** simple possession charges in a ten-year timespan?\n\nFinally, SB108 stipulates that the felony charge only comes into effect after 3+ simple possession **convictions** in a **ten year time-span**.
