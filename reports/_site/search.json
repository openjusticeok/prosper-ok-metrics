    "text": "A bill reducing fines and fees for families of children involved in the criminal legal system (HB 3205) went into effect July 1, 2022 (Q1 FY 2023). HB 3205 struck a clause of 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-2-301 which stated that the parent or other legal custodian were responsible for costs associated with legal representation. It limited the twenty-five dollar probation fee to only those counties that have a juvenile bureau; a provision that the fee only be applied to those with ability to pay was already in place. Prior to HB 3205 counties without a juvenile bureau were directing the revenue from this probation fee to the Office of Juvenile Affairs (OJA).\nHB 3205 also struck 10A O.S. 2021, Section 2-2-509 which required a juvenile drug court user fee of up to twenty dollars per month, in addition to “court costs, treatment costs, drug-testing costs, and supervision fees”. While the cost of treatment was paid to the treatment provider, drug-testing and supervision fees were directed to the Juvenile Drug Court Revolving Fund, and all other costs and fees were directed to the court clerk.\nThis analysis uses OJA referral data beginning October 1, 2022 (Q2 FY 2023) to estimate the impact of HB 3205 during a period of full implementation."

The county and month in which referrals were made are included.\nWhile referral counts provide insight into the number of Oklahoma’s youth encountering the juvenile system, they are not sufficient to estimate the number of individuals directly impacted by the reforms outlined in the section above. We used county level estimates of household and family sizes conducted by the Census in the 5-year American Community Survey to estimate the total number of individuals impacted since the burden of court fines and fees, especially in the case of children involved in the criminal legal system, is borne by families of the impacted individual.\nCounty, rather than state, level demographics are used to account for some of the variance in the number of Oklahomans most directly involved in caring for the youth referred to OJA. Though the 5-year estimates from the Census hold household and family size constant across years, this measure was chosen due to data quality issues with the 1-year ACS associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to Census definitions, household size refers to the total number of individuals living in a housing unit, while family size consists of only those housing unit residents that are related by birth, marriage, or other legal status. Aggregated, household size tends to be greater than family size; taken together, these two estimations provide reasonable bounds for estimating the total direct impact of HB 3205.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2009-2021), Households and Families (S1101)"

This new law reduces the number of offenses that can lead to a license revocation, although certain circumstances may still result in revocation. Additionally, HB 1795 sought to enhance the accessibility and affordability of provisional licenses. The legislation imposed restrictions on license suspensions resulting from “failure to pay” and incorporated a significant provision reducing the minimum payment plan for outstanding fines and fees. Previously set at $25 per month, HB 1795 lowers the minimum monthly payment to $5. The aforementioned fees encompass various charges such as provisional license fees, warrant fees, court costs or fees, and driver license reinstatement fees."

    "text": "2 Data and Methodology\nOpen Justice Oklahoma maintains a database of administrative court records which includes information on all criminal misdemeanors and felonies filed in Oklahoma beginning in 2001. Case information is systematically collected from publicly available data hosted on the Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN) website. This analysis uses Oklahoma court records beginning January 1, 2022 (Q3 FY 2022) to estimate the impact of HB 1795 during a period of full implementation. We explore two provisions of the bill in order to estimate lower and upper bounds for the number of individuals with misdemeanor drug charges that were impacted by the bill’s passing.\nTo estimate the lower bound, we focus on the provision concerned with modifying the types of offenses requiring immediate revocation of driving privileges (Section 6-205). Using the Department of Safety violation codes we pull court records for individuals who are charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance as defined by Oklahoma’s Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act while driving a motor vehicle. Court records also include drug violation codes that are similar but do not specify use of a motor vehicle. These violation codes provide a minimum estimate of individuals whose drug charges would have resulted in immediate driver license suspension or revocation prior to the enactment of HB 1795.\nPrior to the bill’s passing, individuals could have their license suspended or revoked for the failure to pay court fines or fees. Some of these fines and fees are imposed on individuals who are charged with misdemeanor drug offenses. Following this logic, we account for any individuals who may be subject to fines and/or fees due to a misdemeanor drug possession charge. We combine the previously calculated lower bound and adjust for duplicate entries (individuals that may appear in both methods) for an upper bound estimate."
