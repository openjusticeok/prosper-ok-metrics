Case information is systematically collected from publicly available data hosted on the Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN) website.\n\nInitial data pull: All CF / CM cases filed Jan 1 2001 - Dec 31, 2022, statewide\n\n\ndata &lt;- ojo_tbl(\"case\", .con = ojodb) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    case_type %in% c(\"CM\", \"CF\"),\n    date_filed &gt;= \"2001-01-01\",\n    date_filed &lt; \"2023-01-01\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    ojo_tbl(\"count\", .con = ojodb),\n    by = c(\"id\" = \"case_id\"),\n    suffix = c(\"\", \"_count\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  ojo_collect()\n\nOur initial data pull has 2,460,551 rows. Since only the 13 official OSCN counties report the charges in each case, we are limited to just those for this analysis of drug possession charges. 1,440,250 of the rows were from these counties, and 1,438,746 had non-missing values for count_as_filed.\n\nFull list of OSCN counties: Tulsa, Oklahoma, Cleveland, Rogers, Payne, Comanche, Garfield, Canadian, Logan, Adair, Pushmataha, Roger Mills, Ellis\n\nIn the data, there were 740,744 unique cases filed in OSCN counties, compared to 1,761,045 cases filed statewide. Cases filed in the 13 OSCN counties therefore represent 42.06% of total cases. If we assume a similar disposition rate to these 13 counties in the other 64, we can then apply a multiplier of 2.38 to extrapolate our result to a statewide estimate.\n\nData availability, per county:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\nN Rows\nN with Nonmissing Charge\nPercent Missing Charge\n\n\n\n\nTULSA\n503,027\n502,948\n0.02%\n\n\nOKLAHOMA\n486,990\n486,748\n0.05%\n\n\nCLEVELAND\n124,083\n124,074\n0.01%\n\n\nROGERS\n78,098\n78,072\n0.03%\n\n\nPAYNE\n61,604\n60,560\n1.69%\n\n\nCOMANCHE\n47,052\n47,012\n0.09%\n\n\nGARFIELD\n38,612\n38,607\n0.01%\n\n\nCANADIAN\n37,579\n37,568\n0.03%\n\n\nLOGAN\n25,094\n25,087\n0.03%\n\n\nADAIR\n18,518\n18,490\n0.15%\n\n\nPUSHMATAHA\n14,420\n14,419\n0.01%\n\n\nROGER MILLS\n2,942\n2,930\n0.41%\n\n\nELLIS\n2,231\n2,231\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData availability, per filing year\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nN Rows\nN with Nonmissing Charge\nPercent Missing Charge\n\n\n\n\n2001-2003\n171,592\n170,865\n0.42%\n\n\n2004-2006\n179,679\n179,363\n0.18%\n\n\n2007-2009\n184,855\n184,793\n0.03%\n\n\n2010-2012\n184,765\n184,682\n0.04%\n\n\n2013-2015\n234,559\n234,476\n0.04%\n\n\n2016-2018\n227,896\n227,819\n0.03%\n\n\n2019-2021\n195,667\n195,554\n0.06%\n\n\n2022-2024\n61,237\n61,194\n0.07%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Methodology\nThis report analyzes data from 13 counties which report data on charges as filed and disposed, across all complete years of misdemeanor and felony data for charges of possession of a controlled substance. We then use a text classification tool to assist with finding all the simple drug possession charges in the data, which allows us to finally report the number of convictions on such charges per defendant.\nOur figures are likely to underestimate the total number of convictions by a relatively small, but still methodologically significant amount due to the expungement of records over time. The magnitude of this bias will be greater for earlier years, but can be roughly quantified by exploiting the court case id schema mandated by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\n\n2.3 Classifying Charge Descriptions\nWe use the (TOC tool)[https://cjars-toc.isr.umich.edu/] developed by researchers at the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research to perform an initial classification of free-text charge descriptions into the Unified Crime Classification Standard (UCCS). The TOC tool provides estimates of the probability that each classification was correct. We set a threshold of 80% confidence, below which pattern matching techniques are used to further classify records for which the TOC tool has lower performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 20 most common verbatim count descriptions – looking only at charges that were included – are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount_as_disposed\nn\n\n\n\n\nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG\n12318\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE\n10312\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG\n10268\n\n\nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG METHAMPHETAMINE\n4874\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE\n4566\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF A CDS METHAMPHETAMINE\n4541\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE METH\n4160\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF MARIJUANA\n4006\n\n\nMARIJUANA MISDEMEANOR\n3853\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE MARIJUANA\n3086\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF A CDS MARIJUANA\n2718\n\n\nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA\n2567\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE MARIJUANA SCHD I\n2516\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE METH SCHD II\n2064\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF A CDS SCHD II\n2058\n\n\nPOSS OF CDS\n2029\n\n\nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE\n1928\n\n\nCONTROLLED DRUG SCHEDULE II FELONY\n1534\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE\n1292\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE SCHED II\n1230\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 20 most common verbatim count descriptions – looking only at charges that were excluded – are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount_as_disposed\nn\n\n\n\n\nDUI ALCOHOL\n29961\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA\n24833\n\n\nDRIVING UNDER SUSPENSION DUS\n24195\n\n\nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA\n21474\n\n\nOBSTRUCTING AN OFFICER\n19190\n\n\nPUBLIC INTOXICATION\n19048\n\n\nBURGLARY SECOND DEGREE\n17865\n\n\nLARCENY OF MERCHANDISE FROM RETAILER\n17307\n\n\nDRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE\n17203\n\n\nASSAULT AND BATTERY DOMESTIC\n17038\n\n\nVIOLATION OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION ACT\n15400\n\n\nBOGUS CHECK\n15020\n\n\nVIOLATION OF PROTECTIVE ORDER\n13403\n\n\nPOSSESSION OF PARAPHERNALIA\n12465\n\n\nFAILURE TO CARRY INSURANCE SECURITY VERIFICATION FORM\n11183\n\n\nCONCEALING STOLEN PROPERTY\n10637\n\n\nUNAUTHORIZED USE OF VEHICLE\n9370\n\n\nDRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL\n8544\n\n\nRESISTING AN OFFICER\n8510\n\n\nDRIVING WITHOUT A DRIVER S LICENSE\n8492\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we add information on the defendants in each casein order to determine how many have 4 or more simple possession charges.\nOf the 152,556 total rows / charges in the data, 148,126 have an associated person record (97.1%).

The county and month in which referrals were made are included.\nWhile referral counts provide insight into the number of Oklahoma’s youth encountering the juvenile system, they are not sufficient to estimate the number of individuals directly impacted by the reforms outlined in the section above. We used county level estimates of household and family sizes conducted by the Census in the 5-year American Community Survey to estimate the total number of individuals impacted since the burden of court fines and fees, especially in the case of children involved in the criminal legal system, is borne by families of the impacted individual.\nCounty, rather than state, level demographics are used to account for some of the variance in the number of Oklahomans most directly involved in caring for the youth referred to OJA. Though the 5-year estimates from the Census hold household and family size constant across years, this measure was chosen due to data quality issues with the 1-year ACS associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to Census definitions, household size refers to the total number of individuals living in a housing unit, while family size consists of only those housing unit residents that are related by birth, marriage, or other legal status. Aggregated, household size tends to be greater than family size; taken together, these two estimations provide reasonable bounds for estimating the total direct impact of HB 3205.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download data\n\n\n\n\n1 American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2009-2021), Households and Families (S1101)"

Case information is systematically collected from publicly available data hosted on the Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN) website. This analysis uses Oklahoma court records beginning January 1, 2022 (Q3 FY 2022) to estimate the impact of HB 1795 during a period of full implementation. We explore two provisions of the bill in order to estimate lower and upper bounds for the number of individuals with misdemeanor drug charges that were impacted by the bill’s passing.\nTo estimate the lower bound, we focus on the provision concerned with modifying the types of offenses requiring immediate revocation of driving privileges (Section 6-205). Using the Department of Safety violation codes we pull court records for individuals who are charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance as defined by Oklahoma’s Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act while driving a motor vehicle. Court records also include drug violation codes that are similar but do not specify use of a motor vehicle. These violation codes provide a minimum estimate of individuals whose drug charges would have resulted in immediate driver license suspension or revocation prior to the enactment of HB 1795.\nPrior to the bill’s passing, individuals could have their license suspended or revoked for the failure to pay court fines or fees. Some of these fines and fees are imposed on individuals who are charged with misdemeanor drug offenses. Following this logic, we account for any individuals who may be subject to fines and/or fees due to a misdemeanor drug possession charge. We combine the previously calculated lower bound and adjust for duplicate entries (individuals that may appear in both methods) for an upper bound estimate."
