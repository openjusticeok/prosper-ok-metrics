    "text": "2 Data\n\n2.1 Source\nOpen Justice Oklahoma maintains a database of administrative court records which includes information on all criminal misdemeanors and felonies filed in Oklahoma beginning in 2001. Case information is systematically collected from publicly available data hosted on the Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN) website.\n\nInitial data pull: All CF / CM cases filed Jan 1 2001 - Dec 31, 2022, statewide\n\n\ndata &lt;- ojo_tbl(\"case\", .con = ojodb) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    case_type %in% c(\"CM\", \"CF\"),\n    date_filed &gt;= \"2001-01-01\",\n    date_filed &lt; \"2023-01-01\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    ojo_tbl(\"count\", .con = ojodb),\n    by = c(\"id\" = \"case_id\"),\n    suffix = c(\"\", \"_count\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  ojo_collect()\n\nOur initial data pull has 2,460,554 rows. Since only the 13 official OSCN counties report the charges in each case, we are limited to just those for this analysis of drug possession charges. 1,440,253 of the rows were from these counties, and 1,438,749 had non-missing values for count_as_filed.\n\nFull list of OSCN counties: Tulsa, Oklahoma, Cleveland, Rogers, Payne, Comanche, Garfield, Canadian, Logan, Adair, Pushmataha, Roger Mills, Ellis\n\nIn the data, there were 740,744 unique cases filed in OSCN counties, compared to 1,761,045 cases filed statewide. In other words, 42.06% of the cases were filed in the 13 OSCN counties. Accordingly, we can approximate what the statewide results might look like by assuming our end result accounts for roughly 42% of the total population affected by SB108.\n\nData availability, per county:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict\nN Rows\nN with Nonmissing Charge\nPercent Missing Charge\n\n\n\n\nTULSA\n503,027\n502,948\n0.02%\n\n\nOKLAHOMA\n486,993\n486,751\n0.05%\n\n\nCLEVELAND\n124,083\n124,074\n0.01%\n\n\nROGERS\n78,098\n78,072\n0.03%\n\n\nPAYNE\n61,604\n60,560\n1.69%\n\n\nCOMANCHE\n47,052\n47,012\n0.09%\n\n\nGARFIELD\n38,612\n38,607\n0.01%\n\n\nCANADIAN\n37,579\n37,568\n0.03%\n\n\nLOGAN\n25,094\n25,087\n0.03%\n\n\nADAIR\n18,518\n18,490\n0.15%\n\n\nPUSHMATAHA\n14,420\n14,419\n0.01%\n\n\nROGER MILLS\n2,942\n2,930\n0.41%\n\n\nELLIS\n2,231\n2,231\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData availability, per filing year\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nN Rows\nN with Nonmissing Charge\nPercent Missing Charge\n\n\n\n\n2001-2003\n171,592\n170,865\n0.42%\n\n\n2004-2006\n179,679\n179,363\n0.18%\n\n\n2007-2009\n184,855\n184,793\n0.03%\n\n\n2010-2012\n184,765\n184,682\n0.04%\n\n\n2013-2015\n234,559\n234,476\n0.04%\n\n\n2016-2018\n227,896\n227,819\n0.03%\n\n\n2019-2021\n195,667\n195,554\n0.06%\n\n\n2022-2024\n61,240\n61,197\n0.07%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Methodology\nThis analysis looks across all 13 counties which report data on charges filed, and across all complete years of misdemeanor and felony data for charges of possession of a controlled substance. We then use a text classification tool to assist with finding all the simple drug possession charges in the data, which allows us to finally report the number of convictions on such charges per defendant.\nOur figures are likely to underestimate the total number of convictions by a relatively small, but still methodologically significant amount due to the expungement of records over time. The magnitude of this bias will be greater for earlier years, but can be roughly quantified by exploiting the court case id schema mandated by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\n\n2.3 Cleaning / classifying count data\nThe UCCS tool provides estimates of the probability that each classification was correct. We use regex pattern matching to further examine all classifications with a confidence of less than 80%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 20 most common verbatim count descriptions – looking only at charges that were included – are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      count_as_disposed\n      n\n    \n  \n  \n    UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG\n12318\n    POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE\n10312\n    POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG\n10268\n    UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG METHAMPHETAMINE\n4874\n    POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE\n4566\n    POSSESSION OF A CDS METHAMPHETAMINE\n4541\n    POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE METH\n4160\n    POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA\n4006\n    MARIJUANA MISDEMEANOR\n3853\n    POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE MARIJUANA\n3086\n    POSSESSION OF A CDS MARIJUANA\n2718\n    UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA\n2567\n    POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE MARIJUANA SCHD I\n2516\n    POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE METH SCHD II\n2064\n    POSSESSION OF A CDS SCHD II\n2058\n    POSS OF CDS\n2029\n    UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE\n1928\n    CONTROLLED DRUG SCHEDULE II FELONY\n1534\n    POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE\n1292\n    POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE SCHED II\n1230\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe 20 most common verbatim count descriptions – looking only at charges that were excluded – are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      count_as_disposed\n      n\n    \n  \n  \n    DUI ALCOHOL\n29961\n    POSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA\n24833\n    DRIVING UNDER SUSPENSION DUS\n24195\n    UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA\n21474\n    OBSTRUCTING AN OFFICER\n19190\n    PUBLIC INTOXICATION\n19048\n    BURGLARY SECOND DEGREE\n17865\n    LARCENY OF MERCHANDISE FROM RETAILER\n17307\n    DRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE\n17203\n    ASSAULT AND BATTERY DOMESTIC\n17038\n    VIOLATION OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION ACT\n15400\n    BOGUS CHECK\n15020\n    VIOLATION OF PROTECTIVE ORDER\n13403\n    POSSESSION OF PARAPHERNALIA\n12465\n    FAILURE TO CARRY INSURANCE SECURITY VERIFICATION FORM\n11183\n    CONCEALING STOLEN PROPERTY\n10637\n    UNAUTHORIZED USE OF VEHICLE\n9370\n    DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL\n8544\n    RESISTING AN OFFICER\n8510\n    DRIVING WITHOUT A DRIVER S LICENSE\n8492\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nFinally, we add the defendant info onto each case so we can see how many have 4+ simple possession charges.\nOf the 152,557 total rows / charges in the data, 148,127 have an associated person record (97.1%)."

We explore two provisions of the bill in order to estimate lower and upper bounds for the number of individuals with misdemeanor drug charges that were impacted by the bill’s passing.\nTo estimate the lower bound, we focus on the provision concerned with modifying the types of offenses requiring immediate revocation of driving privileges (Section 6-205). Using the Department of Safety violation codes we pull court records for individuals who are charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance as defined by Oklahoma’s Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act while operating a motor vehicle. Court records also include drug violation codes that are similar but do not specify use of a motor vehicle. These violation codes provide a minimum estimate of individuals whose drug charges would have resulted in immediate driver license suspension or revocation prior to the enactment of HB 1795.\nPrior to the bill’s passing, individuals could have their license suspended or revoked for the failure to pay court fines or fees. Some of these fines and fees are imposed on individuals who are charged with misdemeanor drug offenses. Following this logic, we account for any individuals who may be subject to fines and fees due to a misdemeanor drug possession charge. We combine the previously calculated lower bound and adjust for duplicate entries (individuals that may appear in both methods) for an upper bound estimate."

The county and month in which referrals were made are included. While referral counts provide insight into the number of Oklahoma’s youth encountering the juvenile system, they are not sufficient to estimate the number of individuals directly impacted by the reforms outlined in the section above. We used county level estimates of household and family sizes conducted by the Census in the 5-year American Community Survey to estimate the total number of individuals impacted since the burden of court fines and fees, especially in the case of children involved in the criminal legal system, is borne by families of the impacted individual.\nCounty, rather than state, level demographics are used to account for some of the variance in the number of Oklahomans most directly involved in caring for the youth referred to OJA. Though the 5-year estimates from the Census hold household and family size constant across years, this measure was chosen due to data quality issues with the 1-year ACS associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAccording to Census definitions, household size refers to the total number of individuals living in a housing unit, while family size consists of only those housing unit residents that are related by birth, marriage, or other legal status. Aggregated, household size tends to be greater than family size; taken together, these two estimations provide reasonable bounds for estimating the total direct impact of HB 3205.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Download data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2009-2021), Households and Families (S1101)"
