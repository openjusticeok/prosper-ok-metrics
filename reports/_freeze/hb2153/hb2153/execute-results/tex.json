Analysis conducted at the request of [Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform (OCJR)](https://okjusticereform.org/) and [ProsperOK](https://www.prosperok.org/).\nabstract: |\n  We estimate that at least 2,945 Oklahomans have received 4 for more convictions for drug possession since 2001. This estimate is likely to underestimate the actual number of individuals in these circumstances due to the lack of data pre-2001 and other data availibility issues described below.\n---\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nOklahoma's 2023 legislative session saw the passage of HB 2153. This bill, rolling back provisions of State Question 780, makes possession of a controlled substance (excluding marijuana) a felony crime after the fourth such conviction in ten years. While the punishment for a misdemeanor possession conviction is up to \\$1,000 dollars and/or up to one year confinement, a felony conviction for the same crime can result in a fine of up to \\$5,000 dollars and/or up to 5 years imprisonment.\n\nThis analysis uses historical data on convictions for possession of a controlled substance to better understand how prevalent is the situation of having four or more convictions within 10 years. This estimate can inform expectations of impact upon implementation of HB 2153.\n\n## Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='hb2153_cache/pdf/load_data_661009719ab4799c9af431159d5b661c'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Source\n\nOpen Justice Oklahoma maintains a database of administrative court records which includes information on all criminal misdemeanors and felonies filed in Oklahoma beginning in 2001. Case information is systematically collected from publicly available data hosted on the [Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN)](https://www.oscn.net/v4/) website.\n\n* **Initial data pull: All CF / CM cases filed Jan 1 2001 - Dec 31, 2022, statewide**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='hb2153_cache/pdf/unnamed-chunk-1_1f39c3deb569667f675f551fab35b995'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- ojo_tbl(\"case\", .con = ojodb) |>\n  filter(\n    case_type %in% c(\"CM\", \"CF\"),\n    date_filed >= \"2001-01-01\",\n    date_filed < \"2023-01-01\"\n  ) |>\n  left_join(\n    ojo_tbl(\"count\", .con = ojodb),\n    by = c(\"id\" = \"case_id\"),\n    suffix = c(\"\", \"_count\")\n  ) |>\n  ojo_collect()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nOur initial data pull has **2,460,551 rows**. Since only the 13 official OSCN counties report the charges in each case, we are limited to just those for this analysis of drug possession charges. **1,440,250 of the rows** were from these counties, and **1,438,746 had non-missing values** for `count_as_filed`.\n\n* **Full list of OSCN counties:** Tulsa, Oklahoma, Cleveland, Rogers, Payne, Comanche, Garfield, Canadian, Logan, Adair, Pushmataha, Roger Mills, Ellis\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the data, there were 740,744 unique **cases** filed in OSCN counties, compared to 1,761,045 cases filed statewide. Cases filed in the 13 OSCN counties therefore represent 42.06% of total cases. If we assume a similar disposition rate to these 13 counties in the other 64, we can then apply a multiplier of 2.38 to extrapolate our result to a statewide estimate.\n\n* **Data availability, per county:**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|District    |N Rows  |N with Nonmissing Charge |Percent Missing Charge |\n|:-----------|:-------|:------------------------|:----------------------|\n|TULSA       |503,027 |502,948                  |0.02%                  |\n|OKLAHOMA    |486,990 |486,748                  |0.05%                  |\n|CLEVELAND   |124,083 |124,074                  |0.01%                  |\n|ROGERS      |78,098  |78,072                   |0.03%                  |\n|PAYNE       |61,604  |60,560                   |1.69%                  |\n|COMANCHE    |47,052  |47,012                   |0.09%                  |\n|GARFIELD    |38,612  |38,607                   |0.01%                  |\n|CANADIAN    |37,579  |37,568                   |0.03%                  |\n|LOGAN       |25,094  |25,087                   |0.03%                  |\n|ADAIR       |18,518  |18,490                   |0.15%                  |\n|PUSHMATAHA  |14,420  |14,419                   |0.01%                  |\n|ROGER MILLS |2,942   |2,930                    |0.41%                  |\n|ELLIS       |2,231   |2,231                    |0%                     |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n* **Data availability, per filing year**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Year      |N Rows  |N with Nonmissing Charge |Percent Missing Charge |\n|:---------|:-------|:------------------------|:----------------------|\n|2001-2003 |171,592 |170,865                  |0.42%                  |\n|2004-2006 |179,679 |179,363                  |0.18%                  |\n|2007-2009 |184,855 |184,793                  |0.03%                  |\n|2010-2012 |184,765 |184,682                  |0.04%                  |\n|2013-2015 |234,559 |234,476                  |0.04%                  |\n|2016-2018 |227,896 |227,819                  |0.03%                  |\n|2019-2021 |195,667 |195,554                  |0.06%                  |\n|2022-2024 |61,237  |61,194                   |0.07%                  |\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Methodology\n\nThis report analyzes data from 13 counties which report data on charges as filed and disposed, across all complete years of misdemeanor and felony data for charges of possession of a controlled substance. We then use a text classification tool to assist with finding all the simple drug possession charges in the data, which allows us to finally report the number of convictions on such charges per defendant.\n\nOur figures are likely to underestimate the total number of convictions by a relatively small, but still methodologically significant amount due to the expungement of records over time. The magnitude of this bias will be greater for earlier years, but can be roughly quantified by exploiting the court case id schema mandated by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\n### Classifying Charge Descriptions\n\nWe use the (TOC tool)[https://cjars-toc.isr.umich.edu/] developed by researchers at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research to perform an initial classification of free-text charge descriptions into the Unified Crime Classification Standard (UCCS). The TOC tool provides estimates of the probability that each classification was correct. We set a threshold of 80% confidence, below which pattern matching techniques are used to further classify records for which the TOC tool has lower performance.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hb2153_files/figure-pdf/probability-distribution-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThe 20 most common verbatim count descriptions -- looking only at charges that were **included** -- are shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{longtable}{lr}\n\\toprule\ncount\\_as\\_disposed & n \\\\ \n\\midrule\nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG & 12318 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE & 10312 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG & 10268 \\\\ \nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUG METHAMPHETAMINE & 4874 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE & 4566 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CDS METHAMPHETAMINE & 4541 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE METH & 4160 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF MARIJUANA & 4006 \\\\ \nMARIJUANA MISDEMEANOR & 3853 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE MARIJUANA & 3086 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CDS MARIJUANA & 2718 \\\\ \nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA & 2567 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE MARIJUANA SCHD I & 2516 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE METH SCHD II & 2064 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CDS SCHD II & 2058 \\\\ \nPOSS OF CDS & 2029 \\\\ \nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE & 1928 \\\\ \nCONTROLLED DRUG SCHEDULE II FELONY & 1534 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE & 1292 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED DANGEROUS SUBSTANCE SCHED II & 1230 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe 20 most common verbatim count descriptions -- looking only at charges that were **excluded** -- are shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{longtable}{lr}\n\\toprule\ncount\\_as\\_disposed & n \\\\ \n\\midrule\nDUI ALCOHOL & 29961 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA & 24833 \\\\ \nDRIVING UNDER SUSPENSION DUS & 24195 \\\\ \nUNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA & 21474 \\\\ \nOBSTRUCTING AN OFFICER & 19190 \\\\ \nPUBLIC INTOXICATION & 19048 \\\\ \nBURGLARY SECOND DEGREE & 17865 \\\\ \nLARCENY OF MERCHANDISE FROM RETAILER & 17307 \\\\ \nDRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE & 17203 \\\\ \nASSAULT AND BATTERY DOMESTIC & 17038 \\\\ \nVIOLATION OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION ACT & 15400 \\\\ \nBOGUS CHECK & 15020 \\\\ \nVIOLATION OF PROTECTIVE ORDER & 13403 \\\\ \nPOSSESSION OF PARAPHERNALIA & 12465 \\\\ \nFAILURE TO CARRY INSURANCE SECURITY VERIFICATION FORM & 11183 \\\\ \nCONCEALING STOLEN PROPERTY & 10637 \\\\ \nUNAUTHORIZED USE OF VEHICLE & 9370 \\\\ \nDRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL & 8544 \\\\ \nRESISTING AN OFFICER & 8510 \\\\ \nDRIVING WITHOUT A DRIVER S LICENSE & 8492 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFinally, we add information on the defendants in each casein order to determine how many have 4 or more simple possession charges.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='hb2153_cache/pdf/parties-data_d76d0213e8c884d6ca0beb1e21d3249f'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nOf the **152,556 total rows / charges** in the data, **148,126** have an associated person record (**97.1%**).

We therefore limit our count of charges to only those within a rolling 10 year window, arriving at our final result for OSCN counties. Applying the multiplier derived above, we then find an estimate for the number of individuals who, since 2001, have been convicted with simple drug possession four or more times. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{rr}\n\\toprule\nOSCN & Statewide\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}} \\\\ \n\\midrule\n$1,239$ & $2,945$ \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}}Estimated using the disposition rate of OSCN county cases\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n:::\n:::\n",
