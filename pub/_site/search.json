    "text": "2 Appendices\n\n2.1 Charge Description Appendix\n\nThroughout the reports published here, we group charge descriptions together to make the data easier to understand (e.g. combining “CDS POSS.” and “POSSESS DRUG” into a single “Drug Possession” category). The appendix above lists the original charge descriptions and the categories we use in our reports.\n\n\nAll reports were compiled by the Oklahoma Policy Institute (OKPI). OK Policy is contracted by the Oklahoma County Criminal Justice Authority (CJAC) – an advisory body designed to oversee and advise the Oklahoma County Jail Trust, which manages the Oklahoma County Detention Center (OCDC) – to provide data analysis and reporting on OCDC and the people incarcerated there."
